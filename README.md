Current Weather is a modern web application which give current weather status of different locations based on the name of city provided. It displays current temperature of any city in Â°C along with actual temperature being felt, humidity and the speed of wind in meter/second formats.

## About
This is a simple project built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. For realtime weather information, I have made use of OpenWeatherMap API which is free to use but limited to 60 calls/minute for an unpaid plan.
The following items are displayed on screen:
- [x] Current temperature of the city
- [x] Maximum and Minimum temperature
- [X] Feels like temperature
- [X] Humidity
- [X] Wind speed

### Project Status
The app is ready to be shipped.
